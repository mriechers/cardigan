"""Deterministic field length / count limit checking.

Flags-only: values are never truncated, trimmed, or otherwise mutated here
(that's a model-fixable violation to hand back to a later generation pass,
not something the engine does silently). Compares each field present in
*both* the input mapping and ``StyleRules``' resolved limits (via
``limits_for``) and reports ``RuleViolation``s for anything out of bounds.
